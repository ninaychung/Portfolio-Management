# Portfolio-Management

A MicroService Project that allows users to see and interact the contents of their portfolio. Users can see available stock on the market, buy/sell stock, see their order history, and view the status of each of their historical orders. 

Includes:
- A REST API (via Java SpringBoot) to get, post, put, and delete stocks
- MySQL Databaases for persistent storage to hold Stock and StockHistory (user's personal portfolio) information
- A web UI (via Angular) where users can view and buy stock
